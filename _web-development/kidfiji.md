The original version of my portfolio was a WordPress theme I developed from scratch, with layout help from the SASS version of the Skeleton Framework. It featured a masonry-style portfolio gallery that utilized Isotope as well as my own JavaScript code to dynamically filter these portfolio items by category. Its design resulted from iteratively messing with CSS styling until I found something I that was content with.
