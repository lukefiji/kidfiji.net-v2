The [first version](http://www.kidfiji.net/kidfiji) of my portfolio was built with WordPress, on a theme I developed from scratch with help from the SASS version of the [Skeleton Framework](http://getskeleton.com/). It featured a [masonry-style](http://masonry.desandro.com/) portfolio gallery that utilized [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) as well as my own JavaScript code to dynamically filter these portfolio items by category. Its final design resulted from iteratively messing with CSS styling until I found something I that was content with. I eventually felt that the first version of my portfolio was lacking in the design department so I completely redesigned my site using Adobe Illustrator. I then hand-coded it with the help of a CSS grid system.

Since the first version of my portfolio used WordPress as a backend, I felt that it gave a lot of unnecessary overhead, so I decided to instead go static with the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Learning how to use Jekyll was a breeze - I was able to go from knowing nothing about it to creating this website with a few days of work. I can't wait for another opportunity to use it because its templating language, in my opinion, very fun to use. If you haven't noticed, there aren't any screenshots of the second version because you're on it right now.
