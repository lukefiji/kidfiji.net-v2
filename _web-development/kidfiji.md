The original version of my portfolio was a WordPress theme I developed from scratch, with layout help from the SASS version of the Skeleton Framework. It featured a masonry-style portfolio gallery that utilized Isotope as well as my own JavaScript code to dynamically filter these portfolio items by category. Its design resulted from iteratively messing with CSS styling until I found something I that was content with.

Since the first version of my portfolio used WordPress as a backend, I felt that it gave a lot of unnecessary overhead, especially on sp so I decided to go static with and use Jekyll. If you haven't noticed, there aren't any screenshots of the second version because you're on it right now.
