RK Tech is a web development agency that specializes in WordPress and Magento solutions. I was hired as a freelancer to completely redesign the website from a fresh slate. For its construction, I helped them find a clean, responsive WordPress theme. I created a child theme and then designed the home page, portfolio, and contact page. I also took screenshots of the RK Techâ€™s previous projects and had them placed under a Portfolio custom post type. I also ran a query through that custom post type to display recent work on the front page.
