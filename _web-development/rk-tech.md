[RK Tech](http://www.rktech.co) is a web development agency that specializes in WordPress and Magento solutions. Unhappy with their old design, I was hired as a freelancer to completely redesign their website from the ground up. I first helped them find a clean and responsive WordPress theme. I then created a child theme and then designed the home page, portfolio, and contact page. I also helped them take screenshots of their work with previous clients and had them placed under a *Portfolio* custom post type; I also ran a query through that custom post type to display recent work on the front page.

Please excuse the placeholder material that can be seen on the website - I handed it off to them once I had the initial page layouts designed. It's now up to them to fill in their portfolio's content.
