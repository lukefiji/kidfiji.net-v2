First, I worked with my client to find a premium WordPress theme with styling that would go along well with the app. Once we both agreed on one, I went ahead and created child theme, then proceeded with designing the website to what it is now. I also the phone and app screenshots that can be seen throughout the page.

The most interesting (and fun) part about this project was that my client wanted a way for prospective users to enter in their phone number and receive a SMS text to download the app. To do this, I first set up a [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) account for my client and registered him a Twilio phone number. Then I looked around for a WordPress plugin that at would at least interface with Twilioâ€™s API; anything more would be icing on the cake. Alas, the plugin I eventually wound up with wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I had to dive in and modify some its code to better suit my client's needs. Essentially, they wanted it to save a list of everyone that signed up. I also designed and created the form as nothing of its kind was built into the theme.
