I created a WordPress child theme from a base, pre-purchased theme and changed a lot of its inner styling to better fit with the app’s design. I also integrated downloading via SMS text with a plugin that interfaces with Twilio’s API. The plugin didn’t exactly suit the needs of my client so I had to modify code that pertains to listing people that have signed up for text-to-download. I also created the phone and app screenshots that can be seen on the page.
