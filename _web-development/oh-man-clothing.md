The owner of [OH MAN! Clothing](http://www.ohmanclothing.com) had originally purchased a premium WordPress theme and had no background in web design so he contracted me for help on designing their website, aiming a clean and minimalist look that suits the brand's aesthetic.

As their business has grown, it has outgrown their current e-commerce solution, [Storenvy](http://www.storenvy.com), and wanted to move onto a platform that can handle a larger-scale business. With that being said, their team has recently contracted me for work on designing their upcoming [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) online store, which will soon replace their current website.

I have also done [graphic design work](http://www.kidfiji.net/portfolio/graphic-design/oh-man-clothing/) for them as well.
